# Unit-Testing CSharp
:bulb: Unit testing has the greatest effect on the quality of your code when itâ€™s an integral part of your software development workflow. As soon as you write a function or other block of application code, create unit tests that verify the behavior of the code in response to standard, boundary, and incorrect cases of input data, and that check any explicit or implicit assumptions made by the code. With test driven development, you create the unit tests before you write the code, so you use the unit tests as both design documentation and functional specifications. You can quickly generate test projects and test methods from your code, or manually create the tests as you need them. When you use IntelliTest to explore your .NET code, you can generate test data and a suite of unit tests. For every statement in the code, a test input is generated that will execute that statement.
